                            Our staff takes an integrative health approach to meet the needs of the patients we serve, through a highly personalized model of healthcare delivery known as functional medicine.
                            The concept of functional medicine, Dr. Hoyt addresses the interactions between the environment, genetics, and lifestyle and how these combined factors can influence chronic disease and long-term health.
                            Your first appointment is likely to start with a highly detailed look at your medical history, followed by extensive lab work and testing of stool, saliva, blood, and urine. You might receive hair analysis and in-depth studies of food allergies and immune systems. We look for evidence of heavy metal substances, mold, Lyme, and chemical toxicity in your system.
                            It’s only with all of this and more that Dr. Hoyt can arrive at a diagnosis that fits you--not the same one-size-fits-all diagnosis and customized plan that is supposed to work for every client confronted by a physician with the same set of symptoms.
